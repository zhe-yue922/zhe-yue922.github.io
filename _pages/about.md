My name is **Tan Zhe Yue**, a Form 1 student at Chung Ling Private High School in Penang, Malaysia. I am passionate about electronics, programming, and technology, and I created this website to document and showcase my personal projects, academic work, and interests.

This site serves as my online portfolio, a place where I can share my progress in learning and experimenting with technology-related topics. It also includes highlights from the competitions I’ve participated in, as well as selected school assignments and hobbies such as photography.

I enjoy working on creative and hands-on projects—especially those involving electronics and coding. I also have a growing interest in photography and have taken part in several competitions.

**Languages I speak:**
- Mandarin (华文)
- English
- Malay (Bahasa Malaysia)
- Hokkien (福建话)

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about what I do. You can also find my CV, project updates, and contact details throughout the site.
